<p>Originally known as oak, Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and others at Sun Microsystems. It was first introduced to the public in 1995 and is widely used to create Internet applications and other software programs. Today, Java is maintained and owned by Oracle.

When used on the Internet, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which enables the browser to perform a function or feature not normally available. Unlike JavaScript, the users must download or install the applet or program before being able to utilize the Java program</p>
