<h1>programming language</h1> 
<p>is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.
Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script</p>
<p>there are many programming languages but we can put them in lists like what we use to programe a web site and what we use in programming phone apps and what we use in Database development</p>
